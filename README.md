#### Tip: add a Sky Atmosphere and a Directional Light for your sun

## 3. Create the landscape

#### Tip: Start by entering landscape mode

#### Change the number of components your landscape is made up of to 20\*20

#### Start sculpting! Plan out a _**forest area**_ in your landscape. Manipulate the landscape and add dimples, hills, or paths to it. You could use different brushes to achieve this.

#### Add different textures and materials to your landscape and blend them together. You could utilize free assets provided in UE5 or use your own.
